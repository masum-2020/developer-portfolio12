            I am the master of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I know everything
            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular JavaScript framwork called Vue
            Js. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you
            100% web solution.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a programmer and
            web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They
            liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at
            Programming Hero.
